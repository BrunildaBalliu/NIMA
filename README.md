# NIMA
It is hypothesized that certain alleles can have a protective effect not only when inherited by the offspring but also as non-inherited maternal antigens (NIMA). To estimate the NIMA effect, large samples of families are needed. When large samples are not available, we propose a combined approach to estimate the NIMA effect from ascertained nuclear families and twin pairs. We develop a likelihood-based approach allowing for several ascertainment schemes, to accommodate for the outcome-dependent sampling scheme, and a family-specific random term, to take into account the correlation between family members.  This directory contains the R code implementation of this method.
